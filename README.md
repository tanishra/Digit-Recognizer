#  Digit Recognizer using Decision Tree Classifier

This project is a machine learning-based digit recognizer that classifies hand-drawn digits (0‚Äì9) using a **Decision Tree Classifier**. The model is trained on grayscale images from the famous MNIST dataset and deployed via an interactive **Streamlit UI**.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)
- The dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images flattened into 784 pixel columns. The training file (`train.csv`) contains:
- 785 columns: `label` (digit) + 784 pixel values (`pixel0` to `pixel783`)
- Labels are integers from `0` to `9`.

The test file (`test.csv`) contains:
- 784 pixel columns (no labels)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
- Built and trained a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Streamlit-based UI for easy prediction.
- Simple and clean interface to input user health data and get predictions instantly.
